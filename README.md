## Off Chain과 & IPFS
- In general, **Bitcoin** or **Etherium** consists of On-Chain with transaction functions, but off-Chain with a set purpose of use was selected by focusing on the blockchain data structure without a coin system with transaction functions.
- The reason for choosing off-chain is that Bitcoin or Ethereum is usually used to activate financial transaction functions, such as NFT. IPFS is widely used as a means of storing the original data, and IPFS refers to the hash (HASH) that users have as a basis for withdrawing files. If you lose the hash, you can't find the file forever.
- To use on-chain to prevent the loss of hash, the transaction function supported by on-chain is likely to cause waste in management personnel and capabilities.
- This team has prepared a system that is perfect as an industrial blockchain through blockchain tailored to this limited purpose.
